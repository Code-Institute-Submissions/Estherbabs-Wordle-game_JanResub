#### Typography
 The fonts are imported into the CSS file from *[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)*
- **poppins** has been chosen as the main font for the title text. I chose it because it looks appealing to the quiz users and makes the questions clear. The fallback family of **San Serif** maintains the personal appearance.

#### Imagery
I liked the quiz to look sporty and appealing to users who like kickboxing or like sports. the main image used was downloaded from *[pexel.com](https://pexel.com/)*
